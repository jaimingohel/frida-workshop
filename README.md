# Frida Workshop

This training is designed for individuals who wish to initiate their journey into mobile app instrumentation, particularly for Android applications. Upon completion of this training, participants should be proficient in the following skills: enumerating loaded classes with Frida, listing methods and properties of a class, hooking the target function, dumping function parameters, manipulating instances, modifying parameter values, and altering function behavior.

Throughout the training, we will guide attendees through the dynamic instrumentation process, clarifying its functioning within the Android ecosystem using FRIDA. We will assist them in configuring their devices/VMs to establish a functional environment before delving into the actual training. The training level is set to cater to beginners to intermediate skill levels.
